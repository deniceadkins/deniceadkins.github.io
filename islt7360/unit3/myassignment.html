<h3>Topic 1: My Teaching Portfolio</h3>
<p>In the future, it might be useful for me to have a web page or narrative describing my teaching philosophy and practices. I like teaching because it gives me the opportunity to learn new things and put them into practice. </p>
<p>Here is a list of classes I have taught in the last five years:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ISLT 9410 GIS for Decicion-Making</li>
    <li>ISLT 9435 Adult Services in Libraries</li>
    <li>ISLT 7314 Reference Sources and Services</li>
    <li>ISLT 9437 Reader Advisory Services</li>
    <li>ISLT 9410 Leadership for Diversity in Public Libraries</li>
    <li>ISLT 945x International and Comparative Librarianship</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topic 2: GIS for Decicion-Making</h3>
<p>I'm currently teaching a class that is using GIS tools to drive data-based decision making. (This is the latest set of buzzwords for what we've done all along - make decisions and choices based on evidence.) For this class, we're using four software packages: <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a>, <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html">ArcGIS</a>, and <a href="http://qgis.com/">QGIS</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from <em>The ArcGIS Book</em>, edited by Christian Harder and Clint Brown:</p>
<blockquote>Storytellers often turn to maps to illuminate and contextualize their words. Maps are the visual representation of where events happen. As such, maps and stories complement each other.</blockquote>
<p>There are many options for building maps and connecting them with data.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11303845553/in/album-72157638735426654/">a map from the British Library</a>. This map comes from page 551 of <em>Illustrated Battles of the Nineteenth Century</em>, written by Major Arthur Griffiths Forbes and published in 1985.</p> <img style='border:1px solid #cc0000' src="images/ancientmexico.jpg" alt="Map image of Mexico, showing original borders and superimposing modern borders, to demonstrate the Battle of the Alamo.">
